# Word-Guess-Game
This program is a game where the goal is to guess which pokemon is on screen!

The program randomly chooses a pokemon from an array, after that is done the user has to attempt to guess the letters of the selected pokemon (which has its own array of each letter in the word), for every word the user guesses correctly the letter is revealed in the empty array, and for every letter guessed wrong their guesses counter goes down. The user wins by guessing 3 words correctly or loses by having the guess counter reach 0.

The app starts once you press a key and you play the game from there.
